        <p>This website is for promoting the Safety for Paraglider Pilots who fly in the Dhauladhar Range.</p>
        <p>Based in Bir a small town in the Baijnath Area of Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh. 
          We hope to use Meshtastic App and Lora Mesh to do this.</p>
        <p>This is a pure community effort and you will hear more on this site.
        Currently ground testing is underway. Now in the begining of May 2024 we
        are happy that about 20 pilots will be flying with Lora Asset Tracking
        equipment and they will share their location with each other. In
        addition if they have thier Skylines ID as a part of their long name in
        the Meshtastic App, they can be seen on the flyxc app.  <a href="https://t.me/meshtastic_india">Details at
        Meshtastic_India on the Telegram App.</a></p>
        <p>So far the test have proved very encouraging and by the end of May 2024 we should be able to post more information here.</p>
        <p>If you want to participate in this then please read about Meshtastic at Meshtastic.org. There you can know about the Technology being used and
          more about the trackers that Pilots can get for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>We do not sell or promote any devices for Pilots. They have to talk to each other and decide.</p>
        <p>We will post here the help that we need from the community. And ask for volunteers too.</p>
        <p>Our dedicated <a href="https://paraguide.in">paraguide.in</a> Jigish has posted <a href="https://bit.ly/MeshtasticBir">Upcoming Plans</a> for those interested. </p>
