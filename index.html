        <p>Welcome to the Bir Paragliding Community site, promoting Pilot Safety and the use of the Meshtasitic App and Long Range (LoRa) Trackers for Search and Rescue.</p>

        <p>Six months after we started trials in the Dhauladhar Range, from beyond Dharamshala on one side and Mandi on the other, this combination of using LoRa Mesh and Trackers powered by LoRa Technology has proven itself to be the way forward here.</p>

        <p>The Indian Administration, citing National Security, has for many years banned the use of two-way satellite communication for individuals. While there is a process for obtaining government permissions, the sport of Paragliding is not one where pilots are typically granted such permissions, especially for those coming from abroad. The use of such equipment, even for Search and Rescue by private parties, is a criminal offense under local laws, with penal consequences.</p>

        <p>The LoRa Trackers in use by Pilots, both Indian and foreign, are legally allowed in India.</p>

        <p>These Trackers, with a built-in LoRa Radio, are connected to Smartphones (both Android and iOS) via Low Energy Bluetooth (BLE). The Meshtastic App on the smartphone communicates with the LoRa Device for configuration, text communication, and sending Smart location information over the radio in the ISM Band. These messages are directly communicated to other devices up to 50 kilometers or more, line of sight. The receiving devices are programmed to repeat the message, thus forming a Mesh and extending range.</p>

        <p>Over the last season, our members placed Solar Powered LoRa repeaters on various high locations along the Dhauladhar Range. These cover the entire range and also assist in extending coverage when the density of pilots in the air is low. At Bir and Dharamshala, we currently have three nodes that capture all location data and forward it to an MQTT server managed by volunteers from this group. Steps are underway to arrange long-term storage of this data and to establish a policy and mechanism to ensure that this location information is secure and used only for legitimate purposes.</p>

        <p>As the Autumn Season of 2024 approaches, we are upgrading the repeater and data storage infrastructure for this project. Our group has learned a lot about managing the solar-powered repeaters and sharing data.</p>

        <p>The great fun of the LoRa/Meshtastic paradigm is that all pilots in the air share messages and location information with each other without any outside control. The map on the Meshtastic App shows all the pilots within the Mesh coverage, and no outside party has any control or restrictions on it. Also, it is free as no license or subscription is involved.</p>

        <p>Each device has eight channels for communication. There is a basic primary channel on which location information is shared. This is LongFast in our area—Channel 0. Then we have set up the next channel as “BirTalk”—Channel 1. This is where we will share additional messages regarding flying conditions that are not necessary on LongFast. Channels 2 to 7 are open to user groups who can share these as private message groups. These channels use the full Mesh Network, but messages are private as per Meshtastic Software.</p>

        <p>In the past few months of testing, we have shared our findings with the Local Government Participants who, as per local custom, are involved in facilitating Paraglider Pilots. They have shown great interest in promoting safety, and their involvement in the further growth of Tracker usage for Pilot Safety is imminent. As this is a community effort, it is impossible not to involve them. The only downside has been frequent discussions about making these LoRa Devices mandatory for all pilots who wish to fly here. Whether this will happen or not, we cannot say for certain. However, pilots coming to the Dhauladhar Range to fly would do well to bring these low-cost Meshtastic Trackers with them.</p>
