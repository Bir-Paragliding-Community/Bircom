There is a process for getting government permissions, but the sport of Paragliding has not been marked as one, where pilots will be granted permission, especially if you are coming from abroad to fly here. Use of such equipment, even for Search and Rescue by private parties, is a criminal offence as per local laws, with penal consequences.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The Lora Trackers in use by Pilots both Indian and from abroad are legally allowed in India.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">These Trackers with a built-in Lora Radio, are connected to the SmartPhones. Both Android and IOS, via Low Energy Bluetooth. BLE. On the SmartPhone Meshtastic App communicates with the Lora Device for configuration, Text Communication and sending Smart location information over the radio in the ISM Band. These messages are directly communicated to other devices up to 50 Kilometres or more, line of sight. The receiving devices are programmed to repeat the message, thus forming a Mesh and extending range.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Over the last season our members placed Solar Powered Lora repeaters on various High locations along the Dhauladhar Range. These cover the entire range and also assist in extending range of coverage when the density of Pilots in the Air is low. At Bir and Dharamshala we have currently three nodes that capture all the location data, and forward that to a MQTT server managed by volunteers from this group. Steps are underway to make arrangements for Long Term storage of this data and a policy and mechanism for ensuring that this location information is secure and used only for very legitimate purposes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">As the Autumn Season of 2024 is upon us, we are upgrading the repeater and data storage infrastructure for this project. Our group has learnt a lot about managing the solar powered repeaters and also sharing data. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The Great Fun of the Lora/Meshtastic Paradigm is that all pilots in the air share messages and location information with each other without any outside control. The map on the Meshtastic App shows all the pilots who are within the Mesh coverage and no outside party has any control or restrictions of it. Also it is free as no licence or subscription is involved. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Each device has eight channels for communication. There is a basic primary channel on which location information is shared. This is LongFast in our area- Channel 0. Then we have set up the next channel as &ldquo;BirTalk&rdquo;. This is channel 1. This is a channel where we will share additional messages regarding flying conditions etc. that are not necessary on LongFast. The other Channels 2 to 7 are open to user groups and they can share these as private message groups. These channels use the full Mesh Network but messages are private as per Meshtastic Software.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">In the past few months of testing we have shared our findings with the Local Government Participants who as per local custom, are involved in facilitating Paraglider Pilots. They have shown great interest in promoting safety and their involvement in the further growth of use of Trackers for Pilot Safety are imminent. As this is a community effort, it is not possible to not involve them. The only downside to this has been frequent talk of making these Lora Devices Mandatory for all pilots who wish to fly here. If that will happen or not, we cannot say for certain. But Pilots coming to the Dhauladhar Range to fly, would be well prepared when they bring these low costing Meshtastic Trackers with them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Please click on the links below for related info.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">These Lora Trackers are available on all popular E-commerce sites and our members are facilitating Pilot efforts to get these devices and very reasonable prices from </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hubtronics.in&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1724747241743399&amp;usg=AOvVaw15FIYdxOLmMzvXAPq51NPY">Indian Importer</a></span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">To know more about the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1724747241744099&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qTCCgkxEFNdxEirAzPd16">Meshtastic App</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Communities on</span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://meshtastic.org/docs/community/local-groups/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1724747241744540&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PfbA8l6S8CD_OyuuCJvLd">&nbsp;Meshtastic App</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">To know about the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1724747241745084&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HH4ORQLOGAn4zhZppNafn">Lora Trackers used by the Meshtastic App</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Not sure if you are in</span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chat.whatsapp.com/Js21BmFUcfD664XxfgZIOZ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1724747241745540&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qXp8ar5v_waowmu34TXPp">&nbsp;Buy/Sell group</a></span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Group order open now, ending 30 Aug.
