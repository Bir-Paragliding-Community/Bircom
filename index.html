        <p>This website is for promoting the Safety for Paraglider Pilots who fly in the Dhauladhar Range.</p>
        <p>This site is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Meshtastic project,</p>
        <p>Based in Bir, a small town in the Baijnath Area of Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh. 
          We hope to use Meshtastic App and Lora Mesh to do this.</p>
        <p>This is a pure community effort and you will hear more on this site.
        Currently ground testing is underway. Now in the beginning of May 2024 we
        are happy that about 20 pilots will be flying with Lora Asset Tracking
        equipment and they will share their location with each other. In
        addition if they have their Skylines ID as a part of their long name in
        the Meshtastic App, they can be seen on the flyxc app.  Details at <a href="https://t.me/meshtastic_india">
        Meshtastic_India</a> on the Telegram App.</p>
        <p>So far the test have proved very encouraging. In our effort we have set up seven devices that remain working all the time. Some of these devices are
        connected to the internet and send out MQTT messages to our servers. At the moment we just record these and are working out the best ways to 
        store it in the most appropriate form.</p> 
        <p>Five of these devices are on elevated locations and are powered by Solar panels. This ensures that they are never off due to any reason. </p>
        <p>Meshtastic seems to be the way forward of keeping a track of the location of Pilots who participate by having their own devices with them,
        The signals are very good and when a Pilot is over Dharamshala, Bir gets a signal of better than -100db. Which leaves a big margin.</p>
        <p>The only requirement is that there should be a Line of Sight and with Pilots flying so high and our repeater location situated at good elevations,
        the coverage is very good. This surely is the way forward.</p>
        <p>If you want to participate in this then please read about Meshtastic at Meshtastic.org. There you can know about the Technology being used and
          more about the trackers that Pilots can get for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>We do not sell or promote any devices for Pilots. They have to talk to each other and decide.</p>
        <p>We will post here the help that we need from the community. And ask for volunteers too.</p>
        <p>Our dedicated <a href="https://paraguide.in">paraguide.in</a> Jigish has posted <a href="https://bit.ly/MeshtasticBir">Upcoming Plans</a> for those interested. </p>
