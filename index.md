Welcome to the Bir Paragliding Community site. Discover how we're leveraging technology to enhance pilot safety and
improve search and rescue efforts.

## Background

Personal Trackers based on LoRa technology are a very practical way for Paragliding Pilots to share their location with other Pilots who fly with them in the same sites.
Throughout 2024 we carried out  trials in the Dhauladhar Range, with some home-made and other commercially available trackers using the Meshtastic App and firmware to see how this would work for us. We have had some Hubs working all through that period and continue to do so till date.  These have proven highly effective for tracking pilots and providing communication where cellular or satellite coverage is unavailable. Unlike satellite communication—which is
heavily regulated and illegal for private use in India—LoRa technology offers a free, license-free solution.


LoRa (Long Range) is a low-power, long-range communication technology operating in the unlicensed ISM band. When paired
with the Meshtastic app on Android and iOS, it enables pilots to share their location over a decentralized mesh network,
with each device extending the network's range.

Over the past few months of testing, we've had the pleasure of sharing our findings with the local government participants
who play a key role in supporting paraglider pilots. Their enthusiasm for enhancing safety is inspiring, and their continued
involvement will be instrumental in advancing Tracker usage for pilot safety. Given that this is a community-driven initiative,
their participation is invaluable. There have been discussions about potentially making these LoRa Devices a requirement for 
pilots flying here, though the outcome is still to be determined. In the meantime, pilots visiting the Dhauladhar Range
would benefit from bringing these affordable Meshtastic Trackers along.

## Community Hubs in Bir and Dharamshala

From the beginning of 2024, community members set up solar-powered LoRa repeaters across key points in the Dhauladhar Range,
ensuring continuous coverage even with low pilot activity. Community Hubs in Bir and Dharamshala collect location data
and send it to a central server. We are currently working on secure, long-term data storage and privacy protection measures. For the Season of 2025 we hope to organize three more Community Hubs at Kullu, Joginder Nagar and Palampur. It is expected that these Community Hubs will fully participate in the Search and Rescue work of the community as a whole.


In order to give this infrastructure  a permanent shape, we are in the process of incorporating a Section 8, non profit entity. We hope that once this is done, the initiative that has given us a lot of hope, will continue to grow. In addition to tracking, this non-profit will explore ways to expedite the Search and Rescue efforts for persons in distress, in locations that are not easily accessible. Many people have shown interest in contributing to the cause. A Registered Non-Profit will give them such an opportunity. This requires permissions and recognition from the Income Tax authorities and also permission from the Government for receiving funds from Abroad. A lot of community discussion has gone into this SAR initiative.

This infrastructure is being taken care of by many Indian Pilots as volunteers. However, for the sake of permanence,  in addition to these arrangements, other additional paid resources  are also being explored. We thank all those who give their time and effort for this public service as no monetary gains are there for them and they are doing all this for public good. Thank You all.
